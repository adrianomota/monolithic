# Tactical modeling

#### In this project i try to use Domain Driven Design (DDD) concepts,

#### using C# language, .Net core 7 and tests.

#### First of all i'm defining my aggregate roots per class libs.

#### To validations i'm using FluentValidations because give me more flexibility.

#### I'm using Mongodb as data storage and EF Core as ORM.
